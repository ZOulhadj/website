* First program
     #+BEGIN_SRC c
       #include <stdio.h>

       int add(int a, int b)
       {
           return a + b;
       }

       int main()
       {
           int result = add(20, 50);

           printf("%d\n", result);

** Building
     Turning code into a executable program conists of multiple stages. I'll
     only discuss very simple concepts as the entire process is quite complicated.
     There are two main stages, the compiler and then the linked.     
*** What's a compiler?
      A compiler is a program which converts code into object files. This is a
      type of intermediate file that is almost a working program but requires
      a final linking stage.
     
*** What is a linker?
      Once the compiler has generated the object files it's the linkers job
      to "patch" together all the function calls within a
