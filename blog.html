On the 28th June 2022, I successfully passed my driving test. My journey to
becoming a driver started all the way back on the 6th July 2020 when I had
just passed my theory test first time. The reason why I decided to do it is
because a few of my friends managed to get it done and thought to myself why
not. During this time, I was not in a rush to start driving as I simply did
not need to and also I was not that interested in it.
</p>

<p>
Soon after having completed the the theory test, the UK as well as many other
countries around the world went into lockdowns as a result of COVID-19.
Subsequently, this resulted in driving tests being cancelled and thus, not
much could be done during this time. In fact, this remained the case for over
a year.
</p>

<p>
Fast-forward to February 2022 and at this point I had told my dad that my
theory test will expire on the 6th of July. Knowing this, he started to remind
me that I should begin to learn in order to pass my driving test as quickly
as possible.
</p>

<p>
At first, I was not very keen on this as firstly driving lessons where not
really possible due to the pandemic and furthermore, we simply did not have a
car to learn on. However, after some back-and-forths we decided to go all in
and proply start learning in order to get this over and done with as quickly
as possible.
</p>

<p>
So after about a week of searching we found a cheap VW Polo that we could
learn on.  From that point on, almost every other day I would go out and learn
to drive with my dad. At first, it was not a great experience especially in
regards to the gears since it was a manual car. Having this, it only took me
about a couple of days to start getting comfortable with it. This continued
for around 3 months up until my first driving test which was booked for the
6th June 2022. However, this was less than ideal.  The reason being is that
this test was booked for at Maybush, Southhampton. Almost 80 miles away from
London where I live. This was due to every single test centre near me being
fully booked as a result of the COVID-19 backlog.
</p>

<p>
To cut the story short, I failed. It was probably the most gut-wrenching
feeling considering how much we had prepared both physically and mentally. I
had recived 1 major and 5 minors.  The one major fault that I got which
resulted in me failing was accidentally rolling back about half a meter at a
junction on the way back to the test centre. The junction was slightly up a
hill and for some reason I thought I was in first gear when in reality I was
in neutral. So when I was at the "biting point" hoping to move forward on the
main road, I simply rolled back.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, when we arrived back home I immediately started looking for another
test since the theory end date was coming up. I was not looking constantly but
I would maybe check once a day. A week later on the 17th I was up all night
and it was 6 am. I remembered that the DVSA booking system becomes available
from 6 am so I thought why not check since most people will be asleep. So I
checked and like always it was nothing. Just kept clicking "next" to show
further and further test centres until to my surprise there was one open
booking for the 28th of June at Salisbury. Once again almost 80 miles away. It
was honestly my only option and there was nothing else and my theory test was
expiring on the 6th July. So I booked it and me and my dad continued to
practice.
</p>

<p>
On the day we woke up at 4am and I drove down all the way which took around
1:30 hours. Got there at 7:45 for the test at 8:10. The examiner was really
nice and was very understanding and helpful. I passed with 1 minor which was
for parallel parking in which I had to readjust.
</p>

<p>
Looking back, in a matter of 3 months and only 1 week before my theory test
was about the expire I managed to pass my UK driving test. This now means I am
able to drive independently wherever I want. Personally, I've wanted to do
many things such as travel to other countries, take myself to bike races and
so much more which is now all possible.
