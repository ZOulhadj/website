        <h4>Why don't you make your website look good?</h4>
        <p>
                I prefer simplicty and reability over making a website look
                good, cluttered and slow.  I will say though, there's something
                about the 90's websites that I really like.

        <h4>Why do you like programming?</h4>
        <p>
                I find that programming is very special in the sense that you
                have full control of your actions. Every line of code that you
                write a computer will execute and do nothing else. In a world
                where everything is unpredictable and can change day to day, I
                find this strange sense of satisfaction knowing that every
                action has a specific and predictible reaction (often) when
                writing software.

        <h4>What is your favourite programming language?</h4>
        <p>
                I would consider C++ as my favourite language. The reason for
                this is that it provides the many benefits of C and also
                includes certain features that I really like such as function
                overloading, dynamic arrays, type safety and more. In terms of
                performance it can be as fast as C if done correctly which is
                another reason I program in C++. I program in a functional style
                instead of the typical object-oriented style that many people
                like to associate with C++. Personally, whenever I see a
                functional program I instantly find it easier to debug and
                understand, plus the code simply does what is shown (WYSIWYG)
                instead of specific OO style functionalities.

                <br/><br/>

                Languages such as Python, Java, C# and many others create an
                abstraction over the core language that they are developed in,
                often C. Then I find myself having to stick to language specific
                ideas/methodologies and having to program in a certain way
                depending on whoever developed the language instead of focusing
                on the real issue at hand.

        <h4>What area of programming do you like most?</h4>
        <p>
            Writing efficient software. To me, a perfectly written program
            is one which wastes no CPU cycles and is easy to understand from
            a programmers perspective. Sadly, the world is not perfect. I do
            however, try to learn new things everyday that hopefully makes me
            a more knowledgeable programmer.

        <h4>What editor do you use?</h4>
        <p>
                Emacs! Forgot how I discoverd it but once I learnt the basics I
                could not go back to using a mouse.  I've tried Vim and it was
                actually the first "keyboard-only" editor I tried however, I
                could never get used to the mode system in which I had to press
                "i" to edit text and "escape" to get out of it. Felt like an
                extra step most of the time. Emacs does has the weird pinky
                issue however quickly swapped my Caps Lock and Control keys in
                whatever operating system I use at the time, works well. Benefit
                of Emacs is that it do much more than just edit text. Image
                viewing, note taking, document writing, sending email, viewing
                news, you name it, Emacs can do it.
